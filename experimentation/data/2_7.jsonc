These ranges are controlled by the DMTF, not the SMBIOS group. The DMTF Device MOF (starting with version 2.3) has commentary around the Processor Family enumeration that suggests that enumerations below 256 be used only for those processor types that are going to be reported by SMBIOS (because this specification’s Processor Family field is a 1-byte entity).\n\n      • Cache (Type 7)\n\n        - Added new enumerations to Associativity\n\n      • Memory Device (Type 17)\n\n        - Added new enumerations to Memory Type\n\n      • Built-in Pointing Device (Type 21)\n\n        - Added new enumerations to Pointing Device Type\n\n        - Removed out-of-date section Correlation to DMTF Groups, in favor of updated section 3.3."
