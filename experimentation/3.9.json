For a dual-core processor with multi-core support disabled by firmware, the firmware reports a value of 2 in Core Count.\nThe Core Count 2 field supports core counts > 255. For core counts of 256 or greater, the Core Count field is set to FFh and the Core Count 2 field is set to the number of cores.
