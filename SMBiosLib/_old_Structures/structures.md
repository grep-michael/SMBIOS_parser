# FOR SMBIOS v3.3

this folder contains the structs we use to parse bytes into golang structs, and then parse those into actual objects 

#### files are named by what struct type they are, for example type four is cpu info, see DSP0134_3.3.0.pdf page 28, or header.go
#### Page 28 doesnt list all of them, but most
```Golang
	//todo put types here when done
```
